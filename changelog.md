# 7.3.21

* Fixed adventurers spawning in unloaded chunk
* Fixed crash when disabling MCA player model
* Added tooltip to editor to avoid confusion when choosing vanilla model
* Fixed players also having randomly colored hair
* Several Changes to the Naming systems in MCA
  * `SpawnQueue` has been adjusted to properly give villager's random names (IE they don't look italicized when using WAILA-type mods)
    * Note: this only applies to newly-replaced villagers; older villagers and subsequent name replacements will still show italicized in most cases.
  * Player Naming has been fixed and works properly, much like how /nickname systems work (If you have an existing custom name, MCA will use that instead)
  * It is no longer possible to have a whitespace/empty name, and multiple safeguards have been placed to prevent exploits.
  * The `Nameless Traveler` code has been removed in favor of the above fix.
* Added a Homosexuality Trait as a possible chance to spawn with
  * This trait cannot be inherited from past/to future generations

  * Designed to be able to use clothing from another profession, if your mod does not supply any to us
