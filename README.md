Minecraft Comes Alive Reborn
=====================

[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/minecraft-comes-alive-2/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/minecraft-comes-alive-2)

Minecraft Comes Alive (MCA) is a Minecraft mod that replaces Minecraft's villagers with normal player-like NPCs. It works in single player, LAN, and SMP.

Villagers can be interacted with - you can talk to them, ask them to follow you, set their home, give them gifts, etc. Interacting with people builds relationships. Get your relationship high enough, and you will be able to marry someone.

After getting married, you will be able to have children who will do many chores for you such as: Farming, Fishing, Woodcutting, Hunting, and Mining.

Children will eventually grow up into adults. Adults can get married and have children of their own, and this cycle can repeat indefinitely!

MCA Reborn is a rewrite of MCA for Minecraft 1.16.5 and upwards, featuring extended village management, villager genetics and various enhancements.
